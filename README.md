# SimbaDroid

SimbaDroid is an SMB server for Android, allowing you to access the contents of your storage (both
internal storage or an external SD card) from your computer.

Due to Android limitations, this app requires root (as on all Unixoid operating systems, it is not
possible to open a port < 1024 otherwise, and the default SMB port is 445 and Windows doesn't work
with anything else.)
